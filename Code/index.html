                    <h2>How do I play the video?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Simply press on the picture of the bird.<br>
                        Just a heads up, the video is very loud when playing.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The origin of this meme:</h2>
                    <p>
                        This meme comes from TikTok.<br>
                        An user on TikTok uploaded a video with two birds next to each other.<br>
                        These two birds are from "Talking Larry the Bird", an seperate app from the "Talking Tom and Friends" series.<br>
                        The song: "Two Birds" by Regina Spektor was playing in the background of the video.<br>
                        The bird on the left is struck by lighting, inevitebly killing it.<br>
                        Afterwards, the bird on the right screams in terror.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The user has now deleted his or her account, but someone else reuploaded it the same day.<br>
                        It then spread to YouTube, and also TikTok again.<br> 
                        This time on TikTok, someone posted the same video but with the nightcore version playing in the background.<br>
                        Presumably, this has later been cropped, shortend and posted on YouTube to only include the bird on the right whenever it screams.<br>
                    </p>
